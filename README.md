# Solid Test Suite Panel

The mission of the Test Suite Panel as part of the W3C Solid Community Group (CG) is to help software implementers conform to Solid Technical Reports (TR), share findings to advance TRs, and support the communication of implementation reports.

The [charter](https://github.com/solid/process/pull/288) for this panel is under consideration.

## Work Items

The work items in the following table are carried over from prior work in the CG and are currently work in progress. When the panel's charter becomes effective, the table will be updated (to indicate their state, expected completion, and other information relevant as a deliverable.)

|Work Item|Repository|Expected Completion|
|-|-|-|
|[Test Suite](https://github.com/solid-contrib/test-suite)|https://github.com/solid-contrib/test-suite|TBD|
|[Specification Tests](https://solid-contrib.github.io/specification-tests/)|https://github.com/solid-contrib/specification-tests|TBD|


## Participation

All contributors to any Work Items must be members of the Solid CG. Itâ€™s easy to [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/join).

Anyone can join the [Test Suite Panel chat](https://gitter.im/solid/test-suite).

Online panel meetings occur sporadically but when they do they are at https://meet.jit.si/solid-test-suite . Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/tree/main/meetings/).

## Code of Conduct

All work and communication within the Solid CG is covered by the [Solid Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) and the [Positive Work Environment at W3C: Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
