### Solid QA in Solid charters

* SC: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323
* SC: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/
* SC: If you haven't reviewed, please review.


### Add discovery and descriptions for implementation report, test suite, test case
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/542

* SC: Follows actions of https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2023-05-16.md
* SC: Please review.
* SC: Note use of `implementationReport` in the PR which is based on what we discussed/agreed in 2023-05-16. If no objection, we'll follow-up changing `implementationReports` to `implementationReport` in Spec Terms as the whole vocab is 1) in testing status, and 2) there is no publication using `implementationReport`.
* SC: Added some inline issues, e.g., to further detail Technical Report Description.


### Changelog Data Model

* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/536 introduced structured changelog entries into the Solid Protocol. Other specs can follow.
* SC: Proposal: Add changelog to Technical Report Description.
* SC: Let's review the current model and see ways to improve, including reusing or borrowing existing vocabs out there generally about "changes".


### General Planning

* SC: We've been chipping away at the following issues:
* SC: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5
* SC: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/6
* SC: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/7
* SC: But still have areas we need to make more progress.
* SC: Open question to all: What in particular is of interest to you? How would you like to advance some of this work?
