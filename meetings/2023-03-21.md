## Topics

* SC: The Test Suite Panel is a horizontal team where test software developers, spec contributors, implementers, and any other group can join to discuss/collaborate.
* SC: This meeting is intended to focus on processing current open issues.

### Overview
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa is up. Let's see if issues 5,6,7 can be closed and/or split off.


### Specify requirements and criteria for publishing test summaries and reports
URL: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5

* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/510 defined some of the requirements, and marked some issues/considerations that can be picked up in following PRs.
* SC: The PR has a couple of reviews and approvals with requested changed already integrated.
* SC: Any objection to merge?

* AD, HZ: No objections
* PE, MdJ: Already approved
* SC: Merged with reference to this meeting
* SC: Recap on outstanding issues related to terms where we still haven't chosen a vocab.
* SC: It appeared that an implementation can be anything, not necessarily a Software. There are various options in ClassesOfProducts e.g. we could be testing a model so an implementation may not be software. Hence suggestion to require DOAP for software implementations but not other classes. Any thoughts?
* PE: Difficult without an example.
* MjD: There are 3 ways to use test suite: CI for specific version, server running on host, running against public URL. So we are testing the server identified by a URL.
* SC: In W3C QA glossary, implementation is not necessarily software - could be a document or process
* PE: So you are looking at things beyond what we currently test
* SC: We haven't written specs as tightly as possible - we are now adding more about the conformance models. We may have a spec requirement that refers to a model where conformance is required to the model. Any model (e.g. shapes) could be an implementation of the spec so we need to test the model.
* SC: Other examples: WAC has a model for authorization rule. This is not an implementable thing - but something the server does.
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/480
* HZ, MjD: Left as hard stop at planned end time.
* AD: So we are talking about a more componentized view of the system. That makes sense. A document can be part of an implementation, so we need to consider how we test it.
* SC: We may not need this but it could be something we can easily add. Ref: Variability in Specs document where they discuss classes of products e.g. "Responding agent" (e.g. server), "Producer of Content" (not a server). In the test suite, when defining the QA document we need to leave some space so that when the test reports are built, it can say "this is the implementation of some content" which may not be a project or software.
* PE: The data shapes example was particularly helpful to me
* AD: This will allow us to isolate components in testing. Identifying dependencies shall be important in determining isolation.
* AD: When things are too monolithic, we tend to fall behind in testing. Focusing more on components allows us to move towards continuous integration. This should also help with adaptability. Vendors can create components that can be integrated into a server over the lifetime of a system.
* SC: We should welcome implementations of smaller components e.g. a processor that can be used in a server rather than the whole server
