### Overview
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa is up. Lets see if issues 5,6,7 can be closed and/or split off.


### Specify requirements and criteria for publishing test summaries and reports
URL: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5

* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#test-report-description should be detailed like https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#test-case-description
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#test-case-description is alright.
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#test-result is alright.
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#test-report-notification needs some closure.
* SC: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa#project-maintainer-input-review needs more work.


#### Test Report Description
>Document metadata (e.g., license, date, report generated by, submitted by, approved by, notes from the maintainer).
* One `dcterms:license` property to indicate the license of the document.
* One `dcterms:created` property..
* One generated by (TBD / `prov:wasGeneratedBy`)
* One submitter/proposer (TBD)
* One approved by (TBD)
* Zero or one `dcterms:description` (or `oa:Annotation` as a generic thing for any resource)

>Description of the project (implementation) that is tested (e.g., repository, version, maintainers).
* The report is **about** the software described in DOAP (which referred by `earl:subject`). This may be duplicate information because it can be obtained from .. (e.g. https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/reports/2c5af2f0-f832-11e6-a642-0dd857219753 )
  * `<{earl:subject} value> a doap:Project` -- use versioned URI if possible.
  * `doap:repository`
  * `doap:revision`
  * `doap:maintainer`

>    Reference to test metadata (e.g., test authors and reviewers, test review status, version of the test, setup, provenance, coverage) and test suite. Some information can be incorporated in test assertion info (see next point).
>    Test assertion (with URI) providing the URI of the test that was run (with description referring to the requirement URI), asserter (URI), subject of the test (URI), the mode in which the test was performed (URI), test result (URIs and descriptions); outcome and additional information about the test, result, and notes from the maintainer.
>    Approved test reports MUST NOT include assertions of tests with rejected review status.
>    The composition of the summary document is TBD.
>    The report must also indicate the status of the publication as well as other visual cues.

* SC: Will PR and continue there.
