### Overview
* SC: Wanted to talk about next steps and how we make the best of all work in the CG.
* SC: organize meetings by topics, treat them one by one in the meeting
* SC: remaining https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues issues 5,6,7, haven't had time yet to prepare PRs for these. let's try to resolve them asap, so we can point people to that.
* MdJ: we can use this hour for that

### Specify requirements and criteria for publishing test summaries and reports
URL: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5
* ALL: Spent time reviewing https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5#issuecomment-1129987799
* MdJ: We discuss https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5#issuecomment-1129987799 point by point
* MdJ: We check https://solidservers.org/#footnotes to see if enough info is there about test assertions
* MdJ: In the context of https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/7 we discuss https://solidservers.org/#context
* SC: maybe avoid having this in two places
* MdJ: yes, let's aim to move the statements from https://solidservers.org/#context into the policy and procedure documentation of the panel.
* PE: "This reports conforms to the procedures specified here: ..."
* PE: There, we might have different levels. The current reports are for instance not machine-readable. We are progressing towards a standard.
* PE: Equally the test harness doesn't allow implementers to provide any info for inclusion about why some tests are failing.
* SC: the test suite relates to these requirements in the same way that an implementation relates to the spec
* MdJ: Yes, it's good to say where there are some known issues
* We continue with item 4 of https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5#issuecomment-1129987799
* PE: we're not there yet
* SC: yes, I think item 4 is quite a journey. But if you can capture the status of a report, then maybe we're not stopped from linking to it.
* MdJ: A link from the spec has quite a bit of gravitas, so it makes sense to link from the spec to tests only after those tests have been approved by spec authors
* MdJ: we're done with https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/issues/5 then :)
* SC: this was productive

ACTION: SC to PR document about issue 5.
