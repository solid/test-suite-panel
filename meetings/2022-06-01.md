### About

* SC: The Test Suite Panel is a "horizontal" panel where test software developers, spec contributors, implementers, and any other group can join to discuss/collaborate.
* SC: This meeting is intended to focus on the development of a Charter for this panel. Continues from [2022-05-13 meeting]( https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-13.md) where we focus on [whether there is accurate and sufficient information for the Charter, and no major disagreements](https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-13.md#proposal-4-review-results-of-proposals-1-to-proposals-3).
* SC: We may need to revisit due dates for PROPOSAL-5 and PROPOSAL-6 since we had to postpone the meeting for review/approval - due today - for a few days due to holidays and scheduling with participants. We are still fairly on track though.
