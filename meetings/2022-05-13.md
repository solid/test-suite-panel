## Topics

* SC: This meeting is intended to focus on the development of a Charter for this panel. Continues from 2022-05-09 meeting.
* SC: The Test Suite Panel is a "horizontal" panel where test software developers, spec contributors, implementers, and any other group can join to discuss/collaborate.

* SC: Brief announcements:

### Minutes of 2022-05-09
URL: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-09.md

* SC: The minutes clarify what was noted during the official time of the meeting and afterwards: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/pull/1 (based on revision https://hackmd.io/laVtVsz7QkOmXHrzkWxfdw/revision/1652108116393 ). I think we covered good ground so we don't need to repeat or go into the same level of detail in today's meeting.


### Test Suite Panel Repository README linking to Work Items (pre-Charter)
URL: https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/README.md#work-items

* SC: Lists current work items. Will update table based on Charter.


#### Panel and Work Item Repository Access Controls
* SC: I'm looking into having something workable for the whole CG. Will keep the panel posted: https://github.com/solid/team/blob/a34d6f7ff50f5b296eacc47c5fe7f6e25ea7f62f/meetings/2022-05-11.md#members-of-the-w3c-solid-community-group-need-appropriate-access-controls-to-repositories


### Panel's Chat Room Name
* SC: Follows ACTION of https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-09.md#panels-chat-room-name . Still looking into it. Need to send an email from account (solid org) that created the channel.


### Test Suite Panel Charter
>* SC: We need to stabilise a mutual understanding and a coordination plan. To advance our work, we need to agree on a charter that details its goals, scope, deliverables, decision policy (e.g., along the lines of https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/notifications-panel-charter.md ).
* SC: In [2022-05-09 meeting](https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-09.md#panels-chat-room-name) we had rough agreement (but not "ACTION"ed) on SC to create ISSUEs related to PROPOSALs. If everyone is still okay with that, I can do them after the meeting.
* SC: Most of the points below are summaries from prior meeting or common understanding. They're not intended to be exhaustive. We need to be on the same page / rough consensus in order to move on. Do nits later.
* SC: As agreed, exact details of the PROPOSALs are to be worked out in their own issues. Here we focus on committing to *high level* issues/planning that would be useful towards setting the Charter. They will be used as input for the Charter.
* SC: Again, anyone can contribute to the actions (once I create issues and announce).
* SC: We can adjust the date of expected completion.

#### PROPOSAL-1: Specify requirements and criteria for publishing test summaries and reports.
* SC: Publication process (criteria, consent, locations..)
* SC: Distinguish approved/authoritative and unapproved/to-be-reviewed test reports.
* SC: Specify summary/report format and required information in reports.
* SC: Report notifications/request to publish.
* SC: ACTION for Solid Editors Team by 2022-05-27.

#### PROPOSAL-2: Specify requirements for test suite and test metadata.
* SC: Need to provide information about the Test Suite Design (metadata, setup, provenance..), how to Run Tests, Write Tests, Administration, Reverting/Corrections, Notify spec contributors, implementers (new/updates to tests), test coverage.
* SC: ACTION for test software maintainers by 2022-05-27.
